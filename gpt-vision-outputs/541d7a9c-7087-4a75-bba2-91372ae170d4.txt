00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Strap in, buttercup. We're going sky-high!

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here's a window to the world... or a drone's nightmare.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.500
Oh look, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's... just another window.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Enter window cleaner: gravity's favorite enemy.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Working hard or hardly working? You decide!

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Queue heroic music for the man with the squeegee.

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.500
Because nothing says 'adrenaline' like soapy water and a view.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Defying gravity is just a day job, folks.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Upside down, yet still not dropping that wiper.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.220
